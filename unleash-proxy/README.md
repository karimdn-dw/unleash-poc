## Unleash Proxy Demo Project
This is the Unleash Demo POC created to allow us to get an understanding of how it will work, so we
can create a well-thought-out plan of attack.

The demo environment lives here: [unleash-dw-poc](https://app.unleash-hosted.com/demo/projects/unleash-dw-poc)

This is the Proxy demo project. It is a simple NodeJS app that uses the Unleash Proxy to
demonstrate how to use the Proxy and the expected behavior.

### Getting Started
1. `npm install`
2. `node index.js`
